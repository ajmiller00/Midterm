         <h2>History</h2>
         <p>Rêve au Chocolat was was founded in 1987 by French chocolate connoisseur
           Vail Des Meaux. After stumbling into a chocolate making course at
           the age of eighteen, Meaux became immediately fascinated by the art of
           chocolate. Just three years later, following professional culinary
           training at Ecole Chocolat, Meaux opened Rêve au Chocolat.
         </p>

         <p>Rêve au Chocolat was originally located in Kendall Square, but has since
           expanded in size and moved to Harvard Square.
